<center><h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1></center>

Welcome! I'm an MD/PhD candiate in the Indiana University School of Medicine and Purdue University Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering combined [Medical Scientist Training Program](https://medicine.iu.edu/dual-degrees/md-phd). I've recently started my thesis work investigating pitch coding and perception in sensorineural hearing loss with the [Auditory Neurophysiology and Modeling Laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/HeinzLab) and [SNAPLab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SNAPLab). My long-term goals are to create and utilize translational measures (particularly in electrophysiology and computational modeling) to better link scientific findings in controlled animal models of neurological disease with clinical disease presentations. 

I enjoy a healthy balance of coding ([obviously](https://github.com/sivaprakasaman) :sunglasses:), music, photography, and running in my spare time. Oh, and I love a good espresso.
